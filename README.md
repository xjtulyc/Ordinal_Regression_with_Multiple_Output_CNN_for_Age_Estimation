## Abstract

This is a PyTorch implementation version of **Ordinal Regression with Multiple Output CNN for Age Estimation**. Click this link to get the paper (https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Niu_Ordinal_Regression_With_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) 

## The Experiment of the paper

In this paper, the authors proposed a neuron netwok architecture to solve the age estimation problem by converting it to a ordinal regression problem. Importantly, the authors compared two loss function and measured the performance with MAE. The result shows that ordinal regression is better than metric regression.

## How to train the model

```
python train_age_estimation.py
```
